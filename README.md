# Term Project:

## Objectives:
  - Implement Homework 3 - but this time, predict rating instead of positive/negative. So, more classes and probabilities.
  
## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews

## Task: Implement predictor.
### Procedure:
  - Jupyter Notebook.
  - Pre-process and clean data and create vocabulary:
      - Remove special characters and extra spaces
      - Removing single characters - I and a. And others created due to removal of special characters
      - Lowercase all text
  - Train and Test split
  - Vectorizing the document, Remove the stop words
    - bag of words (word count vector)
    - tf-idf vector

  - Classifier Evaluation:
    - Linear regression
    - Naive Bayes

  - Hyper-Parameter tuning on Test results:
      - max_features= between 100 to 2000
      - combinations of bow/tf-idf and linear/naive-bayes
  - store best model and vectorizer.
  - Saving and Loading model and vectorizer.
